						<p class="articles__text">Hello people! Paul Tarabozzo here! Today I want to share my 9 tips for wedding
							photographers to make your life easier, attract more clients, and make them excited to work with you.</p>

							<div class="articles__subtitle subtitle">#1 – Ask more questions.</div>
							<p class="articles__info">People who found you on the internet or through referrals most likely saw your
								photos and liked them if they decided to call you, so now it’s the time for them to like you personally.
								It is very important because for them it is an important day and they want to spend it with a
								photographer
								that is easy going, can cheer them up and fully understand what they’re looking for. Ask what they
								expect
								from a wedding photographer, what kind of pictures they like to have, what kind of guests they’re
								inviting. Show them that you care about their wedding more than about your own photography. When you
								have
								all info about your client and established a connection you can explain some aspects of your work based
								on
								their expectations. Usually, it leads to better cooperation from the clients and more bookings.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="articles__block">
							<div class="articles__subtitle subtitle">#2 – Guide your clients</div>
							<p class="articles__info">If you’re a wedding photographer – most likely you’ve been to more weddings than
								your clients will ever visit in their whole life. It means that you’ve seen more, experienced more, and
								have an idea of what can go wrong on the wedding day or what can help them to save time and make the day
								much easier. For example, I usually start a day from the detail shots and ask brides to have the dress,
								necklace, earrings, shoes, invitations, and all rings to be at their getting ready location ready to
								shoot. Ask your bride to put all these items somewhere so you can start from them and then proceed to
								the
								rest of the coverage, otherwise, most likely you won’t have another opportunity to shoot all the details
								during the day. Such advice will show that you know what you’re doing and that you’re in charge and your
								clients don’t need to worry and can relax. It will make them very happy and as a result, they will
								recommend you to their friends.</p>

								<div class="articles__subtitle subtitle">#3 – Equipment</div>
								<p class="articles__info">We all love different photography equipment- cameras, lenses, like to compare
									them, play with them, but the wedding day is the day when your equipment should work like a Swiss
									watch.
									Before arriving to the wedding make sure that you have all the necessary equipment in your bag, fully
									charged, and your cards are formatted and you have enough of them for the whole day and a few extra
									days
									just in case. Also, don’t come to the wedding with just one camera – it may cost you lots of nerves
									since you can’t ask the wedding to stop until you figure out what happened with your camera if it
									starts
									lagging, or if for some reason your memory card becomes corrupted. You need two cameras with you
									always.
									Regarding the memory cards – make sure your cameras have two card slots on backup, so each photo goes
									to
									two cards at the same time. In this way, you will eliminate any stress on or after the wedding.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="articles__block">
							<div class="articles__subtitle subtitle">#4 – You’re at work, not at the party</div>
							<p class="articles__info">As wedding photographers, we are supposed to establish a good connection with
								our
								clients to get better photos and make our clients happier with our services, but you need to remember,
								that we’re still wedding professionals meaning some small talks are fine, fine to tell some jokes to
								make
								your couple relaxed, but it’s not okay to spend hours talking with guests, being on the phone, or
								drinking
								alcohol – all this shows to your clients and to their guests that you are distracted, not performing
								your
								professional duties, but also you can easily miss some important moments. If you miss something because
								of
								scheduling mistakes, or because of the client – it is okay, but if you’re missing shots because you’re
								socializing – it’s total nonsense and I promise you’ll have troubles. Be 95% a professional and 5% a
								guest.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="articles__inner">
							<div class="articles__block">
								<div class="articles__subtitle subtitle">#5 – Outfit</div>
								<p class="articles__info">As wedding professionals we have to move a lot during the day, so we need to
									have some comfortable clothes that won’t limit our movement. An important moment here is that your
									comfortable outfit suppose to fit the wedding. You can’t wear sneakers with a huge Nike logo, with
									yellow pants and a light green shirt – you will attract much more attention than necessary. Try to
									find
									clothes that will be comfortable to walk, run, kneel and squat all day, but at the same time be
									dressy.
									You don’t have to wear a tuxedo – it will be overkill and usually looks weird, but some dressy casual
									will work perfectly. Think about yourself as a guest at a wedding with some twist to a comfortable
									side.

							<div class="articles__subtitle subtitle">#6 – Shoot everything</div>
							<p class="articles__info">Most of the wedding photographers these days shoot digitally which means we are
								not limited in the number of photos we can take during the wedding day and it’s really stupid when a
								wedding photographer starts to count the photos trying to shoot “only important “ things. First of all,
								you never know what will be important for your clients, also thinking about shooting less make you less
								focused on the events happening around you. If you think that your clients need only getting ready
								shots, ceremony, bridal portraits, and reception think again. I’ve seen newbie photographers that got
								few shots of the bride getting ready and turn off their camera when mom suddenly starts to cry. You are
								there to cover every detail of the day and all the emotional responses of all the main people on the
								wedding day are essential.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="articles__block">
							<div class="articles__subtitle subtitle">#7 – Attention to details</div>
							<p class="articles__info">Wedding is not just a main event – prep, ceremony, photoshoot, and reception.
								It’s a day full of feelings and emotions and we are as wedding photographers have to capture all the
								in-between, capture the emotion of the day, including weather, colors, textures, smell, temperature, and
								whatever else you can come up with. Everything is important and the difference between good and great
								wedding coverage is in such details.</p>

							<div class="articles__subtitle subtitle">#8 – Tradition</div>
							<p class="articles__info">I’ve shot dozens of different cultural weddings – Spanish, Italian, Turkish,
								Indian, Greek, Jamaican, and many others and can assure you that all these cultures are different and
								need some different approaches to the coverage. It is a good idea to ask your clients what kind of
								wedding they gonna have and what is important specifically for them. Let them explain to you what is the
								main feature of their wedding day, what kind of guests they will have, and what this particular culture
								focuses on during the wedding.</p>

						<div class="articles__block">
							<div class="articles__subtitle subtitle">#9 – Know when to take a break</div>
							<p class="articles__info">The last advice for today is kinda obvious but lots of photographers make this
								mistake – you have to know when to take a break. You can’t go to the washroom when the ceremony is
								already starting, you can’t go outside when the first dance is starting, you can’t go to call somebody
								when you have no idea what and when is the next event starts. You have to be on top of everything. Ask
								bride, planner, or MC to wait for you if there’s something that can’t wait. I believe you got the idea.
							</p>
							<p class="articles__info">These are all my tips for today. Hope you found some of them useful for you.
								What can you recommend to our colleagues? Would appreciate your input.
							</p>
							<p class="articles__info">See you next time! Bye.
